# AxialSearch
I created this program for the purpose of getting information about companies on Axial like address and phone number without having to create a new deal or scroll through a web search. All it does is format whatever term you search for into a valid Axial network URL and open that URL in a new browser tab. It does not technically "search" Axial, but it often makes it much easier to find company listings on the platform.
## Usage
Simply open the HTML file in your browser of choice, type in a term, and press Enter or click the Go button. If the search term isn't found, you will see a 404 page.
## Troubleshooting
Frequently, company listing URLs will include the type of company (LLC, Inc, Corp), so if you run into a 404, try searching again with the type appended to your search term (e.g. ACME Inc instead of just ACME). Also, sometimes listing URLs end with a 1, so you can also try appending a 1 to your search term (e.g. ACME Inc1 instead of ACME Inc). There will be times when the company you are looking for has another irregularity in the URL, and for those cases, just search the web.
